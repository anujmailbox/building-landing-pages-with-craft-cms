### Envato Tuts+ Course: Building Landing Pages with Craft CMS
#### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

In this course you'll build on everything you learned in "Up and Running with Craft CMS" and develop a landing page from the ground up.

You'll be setting up your own back end and all the templates required for the front end. When you're done you'll have a completely custom but completely user editable single page site. 

Let's jump in to "Building Landing Pages with Craft CMS"!
